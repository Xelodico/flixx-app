Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

This is part of Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. I highly recommend it!
