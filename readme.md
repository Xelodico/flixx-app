# üìΩÔ∏è About

Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

This is part of Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. I highly recommend it!

## üí°Features

- Includes the most popular movies and TV shows with their own detailed pages.
- Search box for movies and shows with full pagination.
- A slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.

In addition to Brad's requirements, I also added:

- A [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) slider for shows that are currently airing.
- **(WIP)** Shows/movie casts and reviews.
